Project on Data visualization using Javascript

Data visualization is a tool that addresses this gap.

Effective visualizations clarify; they transform collections of abstract artifacts (otherwise known as numbers) into 
shapes and forms that viewers quickly grasp and understand. The best visualizations, in fact, impart this understanding
intuitively. Viewers comprehend the data immediately—without thinking. Such presentations free the viewer to more 
fully consider the implications of the data: the stories it tells, the insights it reveals, or even the warnings it 
offers. That, of course, defines the best kind of communication.

Implementation vs. Design

This book won’t teach you how to design data visualizations. Quite honestly, there are other authors far better qualified than me for that. (You could do a lot worse than Edward Tufte for example.) Instead, we’ll focus on implementing visualizations. When appropriate, we’ll take a slightly bigger picture view to discuss the appropriateness of particular visualization strategies, but I recognize that sometimes the boss absolutely insists on a pie chart.

Code vs. Styling

As you might guess from the title, this book focuses on the JavaScript code for creating visualizations. We won’t spend much time discussing styles for those visualizations. Fortunately, styling visualizations is pretty much the same as styling other web content. Basic experience with html and css will serve you well when you add visualizations to your pages. The examples don’t assume you’re a JavaScript expert, and we’ll be sure to carefully explain any code more complicated than a basic jQuery selector.

Simple vs. Complex

Most of the book’s examples are simple, straightforward visualizations. Complex visualizations can be engaging and compelling, but studying a lot of advanced code is usually not the best way to learn the craft. In our examples, we’ll try to stay as simple as possible so you can clearly see how to use the various tools and techniques. Simple doesn’t mean “boring,” however, and even the simplest visualizations can be enlightening and inspiring.

Reality vs. an Ideal World

When you begin building your own visualizations, you’ll discover that the real world is rarely as kind as we’d wish. Open source libraries have bugs; third party servers have security issues, and not every user has updated to the latest and greatest web browser. We won’t ignore reality in these examples. Instead, we’ll see how to accommodate older browsers when it’s practical, how to comply with security constraints such as cors, and how to work around bugs in other folks’ code.
