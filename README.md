Project on Data visualization using Javascript

Data visualization is a tool that addresses this gap.

Effective visualizations clarify; they transform collections of abstract artifacts (otherwise known as numbers) into 
shapes and forms that viewers quickly grasp and understand. The best visualizations, in fact, impart this understanding
intuitively. Viewers comprehend the data immediatelyâ€”without thinking. Such presentations free the viewer to more 
fully consider the implications of the data: the stories it tells, the insights it reveals, or even the warnings it 
offers. That, of course, defines the best kind of communication.
